# Globetrotter

### Live site: https://globetrotter.rocks

This is a geography app containing a country explorer and a configurable quiz. Test yourself on the national flags, capitals, or country names from any part(s) of the world that you choose and receive a score based on your answers.

Globetrotter is built with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

#### Local installation:

To run this locally on your machine, clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:
```
npm install
npm run start
```
Visit http://localhost:4200 to see the application running locally.

#### Goals of this project:

- Tap into the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) for all data
- Build a well-organized, sophisticated front-end application with Angular
- Include some slick transitions/effects in the app with Angular's animations module

#### Future Improvements:

- Make app mobile-friendly (currently, it looks good only on tablet screens or larger)
- Add ability to view and re-take past quizzes
- Add timer to application to include with finished quiz info
- Make this a progressive web application by following [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) PWA guidelines
- Build out new features: user authentication, ability to browse countries and save those you've visited or would like to visit, and packing checklists
