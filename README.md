# Globetrotter

### Live site: https://globetrotter.surge.sh/

This is a geography quiz! Currently, you can generate and take a custom quiz on national flags from any part(s) of the world that you want. I plan on expanding the app so that you can take quizzes on different characteristics of countries (such as population size and capital city).

#### Goals of this project:

- Build a well-organized, sophisticated front-end application using Angular
- Include some slick transitions/effects in the app with Angular's animations module
- Tap into the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) for all data
- Implement a test-driven development (TDD) approach with the help of Jest

#### Local installation:

1. Clone the project repository
2. Navigate into the newly-created directory and install all dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Navigate into this project's folder via your CLI and boot the project with `npm start`
4. Run the project locally with `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files

#### Running unit tests:

- Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests with __Jest__ (_preferred_)
- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests with __Karma__ (_default_)
